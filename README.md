## My process
I started by drawing out my layout with the different sections so I know exactly what to build. Then I created one section and customized it before starting another section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that flexbox can be very confusing and that if I keep my code simple then it makes arranging the elements a lot easier.

### Continued development

- I would like to improve my understanding of how flexbox works so I can arrange my content easier.
- I also want to plan my solution better so as to avoid mistakes.
